    <h1>Tom's Collection</h1>
    <p>
        I love physical media because it feels real. A disc, a cartridge, a book on a shelf has weight, history, and presence in a way a download never will. Physical media does not disappear because a license expires, a server goes offline, or a platform changes its mind. <strong>It is mine, permanently</strong>. Every scratch, cover design, manual, and case tells a story about when and how it was made, and when I found it. Collecting is not just about consuming content, <strong>it is about preserving moments</strong>, formats, and the feeling of discovery that comes with holding something tangible.

        Owning physical media is also a smart long-term choice. <strong>It offers independence from subscriptions</strong>, algorithms, and digital decay. Formats may change, but a well-kept collection remains accessible, tradable, and often even increases in value over time. Physical media encourages intentional listening, watching, and playing instead of endless scrolling. It slows things down in a good way, turning media into an experience rather than background noise. <strong>This collection exists to celebrate ownership</strong>, craftsmanship, and the joy of building something that lasts.
